# A Ripple Song Podcast Theme

**A Ripple Song** is a modern, all-in-one podcasting solution for WordPress. It separates design and functionality into a modular architecture:

- **Theme (`a-ripple-song`)**: Handles the visual presentation, player interface, and frontend experience.
- **Plugin (`a-ripple-song-podcast`)**: Manages the data structure (Episodes, RSS Feeds) and core logic.

This design ensures that your podcast data remains safe even if you switch themes in the future.

## Key Features

- **Professional Podcast Management**: Dedicated "Episode" post type with support for seasons, numbers, and guests.
- **Immersive Audio Player**: Persistent playback across page navigation (SPA feel) with waveform visualization.
- **Modern Tech Stack**: Built with TailwindCSS v4, Alpine.js, and Vite for blazing fast performance.
- **Standards Compliant**: Full support for Podcasting 2.0 namespace and iTunes metadata.
- **Internationalization**: Built-in multi-language support (English, Chinese, and more).

## How It Works

1. **Install**: Set up the plugin and theme on your WordPress site.
2. **Configure**: Set your podcast details (Cover Art, Description, RSS settings).
3. **Publish**: Create new Episodes just like writing blog posts.
4. **Distribute**: Use the generated RSS feed to submit your show to Apple Podcasts, Spotify, etc.
