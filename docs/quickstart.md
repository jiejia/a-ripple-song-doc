# Quick Start (Example)

This page demonstrates the complete workflow with "placeholder content" that you can replace with actual steps and screenshots during editing.

## Goal

Complete within 10 minutes:

1. Install and activate the theme
2. Create a new podcast
3. Publish the first episode
4. Generate RSS and verify it passes validation tools

## Step 1: Prepare Materials

- Podcast name: Example Podcast
- Podcast description: This is a placeholder description (recommended 1-2 paragraphs)
- Cover: 3000x3000 JPG/PNG (example requirement)
- Audio: MP3 (example 64-128kbps)

## Step 2: Create Podcast

Find "Podcasts" → "New" in the backend:

- Title: Example Podcast
- Author: Example Team
- Category: Tech / Lifestyle (placeholder)

After saving, you'll get a podcast homepage link.

## Step 3: Publish First Episode

Find "Episodes" → "New" in the backend:

- Title: EP01 Hello, World
- Audio: Upload or enter audio URL
- Summary: Write 1-2 sentence overview (placeholder)
- Publish time: Publish immediately

After publishing, confirm:

- Player can play normally
- Duration/file size and other metadata display correctly (if auto-extracted)

## Step 4: Check RSS

Open RSS address (example):

- `https://example.com/feed/podcast`

Validate with tools (placeholder):

- Apple Podcasts validation
- Podcast Index validation

If it fails, check the RSS section in "Troubleshooting" first.
